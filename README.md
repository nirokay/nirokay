God I love Lua, i don't care what anyone says, I will still adore it :)

### Bash <img title="" src=".pic/lang/bash.png" alt="" data-align="inline" width="20">

Bash is amazing, let's me communicate with my Linux System.

Ohh did I mention that I use arch(based) system btw??

### Java <img title="" src=".pic/lang/java.png" alt="" data-align="inline" width="20">

I didn't use java for a long time, so I just put this on this list to make myself looks smarter and cooler!
